                    As the lead iOS Developer for Tipsy™, a startup Shabakeh Gostaran Sabz Persia Co. 
                    was working on, I spearheaded the development of its iOS app. I led the technical side 
                    of the project and developed the app to meet the unique needs of the Tipsy™ platform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We developed Tipsy ™ to reduce the number of heavy coins
                    carrying every day. Tipsy ™ is a platform that handles
                    Micro-Payments by credit cards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next time you can tip a waiter with tipsy, directly from
                    your credit card. Street sellers, musicians, performers, and
                    anyone can use Tipsy as a new income channel and let their
                    audience to pay with credit cards.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In this app I used crisp to provide live support, Fabric
                    Crashlytics to analyze our user's behaviour and our app
                    bugs, PayCardsRecognizer to scan credit cards, Google &
                    Facebook & Apple Sign In, etc.

                     employees to view available services and select the ones they are able to perform. 
                     Its purpose was to streamline internal processes and enhance productivity within the company.

                    I developed an iOS mobile app for a startup operating in the IoT field, 
                    allowing users to control their cars using their smartphones. With this app,
                     users have the ability to remotely access and manage various features of their vehicles

                    You can control almost everything in you for example you can

                    your car, you can even listen to your car’s cabin voices if

                    This is SMS Police. This app separates the spam SMS messages
                    and puts it in a different folder on your iOS device's
                    official messages app.

                  <p>
                    Apple doesn't allow developers to read or manipulate SMS
                    Messages but with the help of "Message Filter Extension" we
                    can create an app with some rules specified in it that can
                    decide if a message is spam or nor.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I used <strong>machine learning</strong> in this app so the ML model will get
                    better in deciding which message is spam.

                    In this app, I put another passion of mine into app
                    development and that is “Magic tricks”. I made some magical
                    code that somehow “I won’t tell ya :D” it can give you the
                    information when you get a picture from your friend’s face.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    All your friends will think that you are a special secret
                    agent and you should never tell them how this app works.

                    I have a huge interest in making games with unity but in
                    this project, I wanted to see if I can make a game with just
                    pure swift.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I have some experience with spriteKit for 2d games and
                    sceneKit for 3d games but in this game, I didn't use them
                    and made everything with default iOS methods.

                  <p>
                    This is another game that I developed with pure swift and in
                    this game, numbers will fall from the top of the screen and
                    before they reach the keypad you should type those numbers.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Game speed will increase over time and also the numbers will
                    get bigger.

                    In this project, I just wanted to implement custom flow
                    layout in UICollectionView & all sorts of animations.
                  </p>

                  <p>It was inspired by the famous app named “Hooked”.</p>

                <p>
                  As an experienced iOS developer, I have worked on numerous projects and have gained
                   expertise in various technologies and tools. My tech stack includes the latest
                    iOS development frameworks such as UIKit, SwiftUI, CoreData, and CoreAnimation.
                     I have also worked with third-party libraries such as Alamofire, Snapkit, Fabric
                      Crashlytics, Firebase, and PayCardsRecognizer to implement advanced features in my apps.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  In addition, I am familiar with game development
                   frameworks such as SpriteKit, SceneKit, and Unity(C#) and have experience in integrating 
                   social media and payment gateway SDKs like Facebook Sign in, Google Sign in, and Apple Sign in.
                    I also have knowledge in backend development technologies like MongoDB, SQL, and Firebase to
                     develop serverless applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With a passion for keeping up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the industry,
                   I am always excited to learn and implement new features into my apps. I believe that 
                   my technical skills and dedication to producing high-quality work can make a significant
                    contribution to any iOS development project.
