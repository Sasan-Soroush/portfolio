                    We invented Tipsy ™ to reduce the number of heavy coins
                    carrying every day. Tipsy ™ is a platform that handles
                    Micro-Payments by credit cards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next time you can tip a waiter with tipsy, directly from
                    your credit card. Street sellers, musicians, performers, and
                    anyone can use Tipsy as a new income channel and let their
                    audience to pay with credit cards.

                  <p>
                    In this app I used crisp to provide live support, Fabric
                    Crashlytics to analyze our user's behaviour and our app
                    bugs, PayCardsRecognizer to scan credit cards, Google &
                    Facebook & Apple Sign In, etc.

                    This is SMS Police. This app separates the spam SMS messages
                    and puts it in a different folder on your iOS device's
                    official messages app.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Apple doesn't allow developers to read or manipulate SMS
                    Messages but with the help of "Message Filter Extension" we
                    can create an app with some rules specified in it that can
                    decide if a message is spam or nor.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I used machine learning in this app so the ml model will get
                    better in deciding which message is spam.

                  <p>
                    You can control almost everything in you for example you can
                    turn off and lock down your car if a thief tries to steal
                    your car, you can even listen to your car’s cabin voices if
                    you want to or so many more cool stuff.

                    In this app, I put another passion of mine into app
                    development and that is “Magic tricks”. I made some magical
                    code that somehow “I won’t tell ya :D” it can give you the
                    information when you get a picture from your friend’s face.

                  <p>
                    All your friends will think that you are a special secret
                    agent and you should never tell them how this app works.

                    I have a huge interest in making games with unity but in

                    pure swift.

                  <p>
                    I have some experience with spriteKit for 2d games and
                    sceneKit for 3d games but in this game, I didn't use them
                    and made everything with default iOS methods.

                    This is another game that I developed with pure swift and in
                    this game, numbers will fall from the top of the screen and
                    before they reach the keypad you should type those numbers.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Game speed will increase over time and also the numbers will
                    get bigger.

                    In this project, I just wanted to implement custom flow
                    layout in UICollectionView & all sorts of animations.
                  </p>

                  <p>It was inspired by the famous app named “Hooked”.</p>

                  I can make
                  <strong>beautiful interactive UI & Animations</strong> and I
                  like to give the user a great experience exploring the apps
                  that I’ve built.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also prefer making UI Components all by code because I find
                  it more comfortable for me But I can make any sort of UI Using
                  Storyboards too. (I didn’t start to implement
                  <strong>SwiftUI</strong> Yet because there are a large
                  percentage of people who didn’t update their OS to iOS 13)
                </p>
                <p>
                  The libraries that I often use are:
                  <strong
                    >Alamofire, Snapkit, Fabric Crashlytics, Google Sign in,
                    Facebook Sign in, Apple Sign in</strong
                  >, etc. I also have some experience with apple built-in
                  frameworks such as
                  <strong>SpriteKit, SceneKit, MessageFilterExtensions</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I worked with other languages and softwares like
                  <strong
                    >Unity(C#), Unreal Engine, Blender, React JS for making web
                    apps, MongoDB, SQL</strong
                  >, etc. But I’m not an expert in any of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I would love to research, learn, and implement any new feature
                  into my applications fast and convenient.
